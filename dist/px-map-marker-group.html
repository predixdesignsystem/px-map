This subcomponent lets the user load a large number of markers onto her map, and
groups the marker in clusters based on proximity. These clusters are updated as
the user zooms in and out of the map.

### Usage

    <px-map fit-to-markers flex-to-size>
      <px-map-tile-layer url="https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png"></px-map-tile-layer>
      <px-map-marker-group name="Plaques" data="{{geoJSON}}"></px-map-marker-group>
    </px-map>

### Defining your FeatureCollection and Features

The `data` attribute expects a GeoJSON feature collection (http://geojson.org/geojson-spec.html)
with specific settings configured to draw each marker.

#### FeatureCollection Format

The root JavaScript Object passed to the `data` attribute should be a FeatureCollection
object with the following keys/values:

- {String} `type`: Must be 'FeatureCollection'
- {Array}  `features`: An array of feature objects

The feature collection should be formatted like this:

    {
      "type": "FeatureCollection",
      "features": [...]
    }

These are required settings. Not including them or mis-formatting them will result
in your marker group failing to draw. (An error may be logged to the console with
a descripton of the issue if it is found. Some formatting issues may not be
caught and cause a silent failure or an exception to be raised.)

#### Feature Format

Each entry in the FeatureCollection array should be a JavaScript Object formatted
as a Feature with the following keys/values:

- {String} `type`: Must be 'Feature'
- {Number} `id`: A unique numeric ID. If the feature is changed, it should keep its ID. No other features in the collection should have the same ID.
- {Object} `geometry`
- {String} `geometry.type`: Must be 'Point'
- {Array}  `geometry.coordinates`: a pair of coordinates in `[lng,lat]` order
- {Object} `properties`
- {Object} `properties.marker-icon`: Settings to configure a marker icon
- {Object} `properties.marker-popup`: [OPTIONAL] Settings to configure a marker icon

For example, here is a feature that is drawn with a "static" marker icon (from `px-map-marker-static`):

    {
      "type": "Feature",
      "id": 748082,
      "geometry": {
        "type": "Point",
        "coordinates": [-117.273809,32.840128]
      },
      "properties": {
        "marker-icon": {
          "icon-base": "static-icon",
          "icon-type": "info"
        }
      }
    }

#### Defining the marker icon

The `properties.marker-icon` object should describe the type of marker
icon that should be drawn and the settings for that marker icon.

Define the marker icon base using the `properties.marker-icon.icon-base` property.
Choose from any of the built-in markers provided with `px-map`:

- 'static-icon'
- 'symbol-icon'

To configure the icon, pass additional settings in the format
`properties.marker-icon.icon-[SETTING]` in dash case. For example,
this would configure the feature to use a "symbol" marker icon
with a briefcase symbol and the warning color:

    {
      "type": "Feature",
      "id": 984093,
      "geometry": {
        "type": "Point",
        "coordinates": [-110.948009,37.984995]
      },
      "properties": {
        "marker-icon": {
          "icon-base": "symbol-icon",
          "icon-symbol-class": "fa fa-briefcase",
          "icon-type": "warning"
        }
      }
    }

See the API documentation pages for the `px-map-marker-*` components
for more information on what markers icons and settings are available.

#### The `icon-type` is special

The `properties.marker-icon.icon-type` property is special and is used for more
than configuring the type setting of your chosen marker. This setting also defines
the color this marker will be represented as in a cluster. See the `colorsByType`
property documentation for more information on choosing your own colors
for each type. By default, the following colors will be used:

- 'unknown': gray
- 'info': blue
- 'warning': yellow
- 'important': red

#### Binding a popup

Popups can also be bound to individual markers inside the marker group. The
popup will be opened when the user clicks on the un-clustered marker.

(It will not open if the user clicks on the cluster icon that contains the marker.
Popups cannot be bound to cluster icons.)

Use the `properties.marker-popup` object to describe the type of popup that should
be attached and the settings for that popup.

Define the popup base using the `properties.marker-popup.popup-base` property.
Choose from any of the built-in popups provided with `px-map`:

- 'info-popup'
- 'data-popup'

To configure the popup, pass additional settings in the format
`properties.marker-popup.popup-[SETTING]` in dash case. For example,
this would configure the feature to use an "info" popup with a title
and description text:

    {
      "type": "Feature",
      "id": 984093,
      "geometry": {
        "type": "Point",
        "coordinates": [-110.948009,37.984995]
      },
      "properties": {
        "marker-icon": {
          "icon-base": "static-icon",
          "icon-type": "info"
        },
        "marker-popup": {
          "popup-base": "info-popup",
          "popup-title": "Title here",
          "popup-description": "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing..."
        }
      }
    }
