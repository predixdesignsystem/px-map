This subcomponent creates a static marker that can be attached to the map.

The marker can be used to show a point-of-interest or represent a physical asset.
It can be configured to show an asset's state (through color) and updated
when the asset's state changes.

Place a popup inside the `px-map-marker-static` to show data about the point
to the user when they tap, hover over, or interact with the marker.

Interactions with the marker will trigger events (documented on the component's
API page). Attach a listener to the marker or its parent component(s) to trigger
view changes that show additional data about the point elsewhere in your app.

### Usage

Use this component inside of a `px-map` element, or inside of a `px-map-layer-group`
element to group it with other geospatial visualizations.

Enable the `fit-to-markers` attribute on the parent `px-map` element to automatically
fit this marker and any other markers drawn within the visual boundaries of the
map when it is first loaded.

For example, the following map will show a single marker within a layer group
and automatically fit the marker in the view when the map is loaded:

    <px-map fit-to-markers>
      <px-map-layer-group name="Landmarks">
        <px-map-marker-static lat="35.6654861" lng="139.7706668" type="info"></px-map-marker-static>
      </px-map-layer-group>
    </px-map>

You can place multiple markers on a px-map or within a px-map-layer-group:

    <px-map fit-to-markers>
      <px-map-marker-static lat="37.7654861" lng="-122.8706668" type="warning"></px-map-marker-static>
      <px-map-marker-static lat="37.6654861" lng="-122.7706668" type="unknown"></px-map-marker-static>
      <px-map-marker-static lat="37.9654861" lng="-122.9706668" type="info"></px-map-marker-static>
    </px-map>
